# LibDS C

This is a re-implementation of LibDS in plain-old C. For the moment, this code is not really uselful, since I doing this just because I want to learn to use C. 

You will find a lot of mistakes here, be it design choices or just dumb mistakes. If you spot something, I would be very grateful if you could tell me about it (or make a pull request).

And yes, I will remove the dreaded *qmake* projects and project includes a little bit later...
